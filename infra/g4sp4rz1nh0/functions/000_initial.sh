# To increese the security, by default this script will change the country related with the TOR INSTANCE.
# It's a good strategy to reduce even more the chances of still using the same compromised TOR RELAY.
# In summary this option will reduce even more the total amount of date that your adversary will be able to collect on his compromised TOR RELAY.
# Set this options to "NO" if you do not expect change the countries. It's usefull for specific cases of GeoIP bypass.

                           Ps: To setup the list of countries you must edit the configuration
                           file. This options will control how the script will manipulate the
                           TOR ENTRY NODE and the TOR EXIT NODE.
       
                           The options for the (R)elay (E)nforcing are:
                           1) entry: Sets a specific country as ENTRY relay
                                     and will use a different country as EXIT relay.
                                     The load balancing algorithm is: Round Robin.

                           2) exit:  Sets a specific country as EXIT relay
                                     and will use a different country as ENTRY relay.
                                     This option give you the control of the EXIT relays and
                                     could be used to bypass GeoIP protections.
                                     Whoever reduces the number of EXIT realys available.
                                     The load balancing algorithm is: Round Robin.

                           3) speed: This option is the fastest option because reduces the
                                     delay between the hops of relays inside TOR network by
                                     setting the same country as ENTRY and EXIT node.
                                     All other countries will be set as EXCLUDE NODES, so the
                                     middle relay will hopefully also be selected inside the
                                     same country.

                                     The load balancing algorithm for this option is:
                                     Least Connections Round Robin.

                                     This algorithm sends the next request for the instances
                                     with least number of request in the queue but still
                                     performing the load balancing between all other instances.

                                     Do not use this option for sensitive activities because
                                     it could reduce the security if you consider that your
                                     adversary could easily compromise a TOR ENTRY-NODE and
                                     a TOR EXIT-NODE in the same country.
                                   
                                     Some countries doesn't have ENTRY GUARDS and EXIT NODES
                                     enough to create a valid circuits.
